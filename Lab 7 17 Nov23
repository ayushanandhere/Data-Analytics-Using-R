Lab Exercise 7: Customer Purchase Analysis for E-commerce Company
___________________________________________________________________________________
You are a data analyst working for an e-commerce company that specializes in selling a variety
of products online. The company aims to analyze customer purchase data comprehensively to
gain insights into customer behaviour and spending patterns. Your goal is to develop a R
program that performs an in-depth analysis of customer purchase data. You will calculate
various statistical measures and generate visualizations to understand the distribution of
purchase amounts among customers.
Note: Load the necessary libraries, including the dplyr and ggplot2 packages. Given the
example customer purchase data provided below, create a data frame named purchase_data
with two columns: CustomerID and PurchaseAmount.
Calculate and display the following statistical measures:
i. Mean (average) purchase amount
ii. Median purchase amount
iii. Standard deviation of purchase amounts
iv. 1st quartile (25th percentile) of purchase amounts
v. 3rd quartile (75th percentile) of purchase amounts
Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts using the ggplot2 package.
Display the histogram with appropriate labels and titles.
Example Customer Purchase Data:

Modifications:
1. Increase the number of samples in the in the purchase data set and
execute.
2. Generate histogram with different number of bins.
3. Apply different colors for the histogram.

# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Example customer purchase data with more samples
purchase_data <- data.frame(
  CustomerID = c(101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110),
  PurchaseAmount = c(150, 200, 120, 300, 80, 180, 250, 130, 220, 170)
)

# calculate statistical measures
mean_purchase <- mean(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount)
median_purchase <- median(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount)
sd_purchase <- sd(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount)
q1_purchase <- quantile(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount, probs = 0.25)
q3_purchase <- quantile(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount, probs = 0.75)

# Display results
cat("Mean Purchase Amount:", mean_purchase, "\n")
cat("Median Purchase Amount:", median_purchase, "\n")
cat("Standard Deviation of Purchase Amounts:", sd_purchase, "\n")
cat("1st Quartile of Purchase Amounts:", q1_purchase, "\n")
cat("3rd Quartile of Purchase Amounts:", q3_purchase, "\n")

# Create a histogram with different number of bins and colors
ggplot(purchase_data, aes(x = PurchaseAmount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Purchase Amounts", x = "Purchase Amount", y = "Frequency")

Lab Exercise 10: Exploring Data Manipulation with dplyr Package
In this exercise, you will delve into data manipulation using the dplyr package in R. You will
perform operations that empower you to filter, select, mutate, group, summarize, arrange, and
join data frames. The dplyr package provides a streamlined approach to enhance your ability to
manipulate and transform data efficiently, making it a vital tool for data analysis tasks.
● Filter and Select: Apply the filter() function to extract rows that satisfy certain conditions
from a given data frame. Additionally, employ the select() function to choose specific
columns from the data
● frame.
● Mutate: Utilize the mutate() function to create new variables or modify existing ones
within the data frame, thus enriching your dataset with calculated values.
● Group and Summarize: Harness the power of the group_by() function to group data
based on specific variables. Then, employ the summarize() function to compute
summary statistics within each group.
● iv. Arrange: Leverage the arrange() function to sort the data frame based on the values
of selected variables, helping you gain insights from organized data.
● v. Join: Explore the join() function, which allows you to merge multiple data frames
based on
● common variables, thereby combining information for a comprehensive analysis.

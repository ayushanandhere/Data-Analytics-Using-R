Lab Exercise 11: Data Analysis: Statement: Customer Purchase Analysis You are a data
analyst at an e-commerce company that sells a variety of products online. The company has
provided you with a dataset containing information about customer purchases. Your task is to
perform a comprehensive data analysis to gain insights into customer behavior and spending
patterns.
Dataset Description:
The dataset customer_purchases.csv contains the following columns:
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Purchase Amount: The amount spent by the customer on a purchase.
Problem Tasks:
You are required to perform the following tasks using R:
Task 1: Load the Dataset
Load the necessary libraries, including readr and dplyr.
Read the dataset customer_purchases.csv into a data frame named purchase_data.
Task 2: Data Summary
Calculate and display the total number of records in the dataset.
Calculate and display the total number of unique customers in the dataset.
Task 3: Calculate Statistical Measures
Calculate and display the mean (average) purchase amount.
Calculate and display the median purchase amount.
Calculate and display the standard deviation of purchase amounts.
Task 4: Customer Segmentation
Create a new column named Segment in the purchase_data data frame based on the
following criteria:
"Low Spender" if the purchase amount is less than the median.
"High Spender" if the purchase amount is greater than or equal to the median.
Task 5: Visualize Data
Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts

# Load the necessary libraries
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Create a sample dataframe
purchase_data <- data.frame(
  CustomerID = 1:10,
  PurchaseAmount = c(150, 200, 100, 300, 250, 180, 220, 350, 280, 320)
)

# Display the sample dataframe
cat("Task 1: Loaded Dataframe\n")
print(purchase_data)

# Task 2: Data Summary
# Calculate and display the total number of records
total_records <- nrow(purchase_data)
cat("\nTask 2.1: Total Number of Records\n")
print(total_records)

# Calculate and display the total number of unique customers
unique_customers <- length(unique(purchase_data$CustomerID))
cat("\nTask 2.2: Total Number of Unique Customers\n")
print(unique_customers)

# Task 3: Calculate Statistical Measures
# Calculate and display the mean purchase amount
mean_purchase <- mean(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount, na.rm = TRUE)
cat("\nTask 3.1: Mean Purchase Amount\n")
print(mean_purchase)

# Calculate and display the median purchase amount
median_purchase <- median(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate and display the standard deviation of purchase amounts
std_dev_purchase <- sd(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount, na.rm = TRUE)
cat("\nTask 3.3: Standard Deviation of Purchase Amounts\n")
print(std_dev_purchase)

# Task 4: Customer Segmentation
# Create a new column 'Segment' based on purchase amount
purchase_data <- purchase_data %>%
  mutate(Segment = ifelse(PurchaseAmount < median_purchase, "Low Spender", "High Spender"))

# Display the updated dataframe
cat("\nTask 4: Customer Segmentation\n")
print(purchase_data)

# Task 5: Visualize Data
# Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts using ggplot2
hist = ggplot(purchase_data, aes(x = PurchaseAmount)) +

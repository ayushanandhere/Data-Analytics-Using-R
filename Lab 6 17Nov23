Lab Exercise 6: R functions for statistical analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a data analyst at a retail company that sells products online. The company is interested
in predicting sales for the upcoming months to better manage inventory and plan marketing
strategies. As part of your role, you need to develop a program that utilizes time series analysis
to forecast sales based on a historical sales dataset.
Write an R program to forecast sales for the next three months using time series analysis
techniques. The program should perform the following steps:
i. Load the required libraries, including the forecast package.
ii. Create a data frame with two columns: Month and Sales. The Month column should contain a
sequence of dates from January 2023 to June 2023 (inclusive), and the Sales column should
contain the corresponding sales amounts (12000, 15000, 18000, 16000, 20000, 22000).
iii. Convert the sales data into a time series object with a monthly frequency.
iv. Fit an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to the sales time series
using the auto.arima() function.
v. Forecast sales for the next three months using the fitted ARIMA model and the forecast()
function.
vi. Display the forecasted sales results, including point forecasts and prediction intervals.

Modification: Modify the input data to 12 months sales data. Fit ARIMA model and forecast 4
future values. Plot the forecast.

# Load required libraries
library(forecast)

# Create a data frame with Month and sales columns for 12 months
sales_data <- data.frame(
  Month = seq(as.Date("2023-01-01"), as.Date("2023-12-01"), by = "months"),
  Sales = c(12000, 15000, 18000, 16000, 20000, 22000, 25000, 28000, 30000, 32000, 35000, 38000)
)

print(sales_data)
print(sales_data$Month)
print(sales_data$Sales)

# Convert to time series data/object for use with R functions for time series data analysis (Function: ts())
# Frequency 12 makes it a monthly time series (Jan-Dec due to 12 values of sales).
sales_ts <- ts(sales_data$Sales, frequency = 12)

print(sales_ts)

# Fit ARIMA model (From forecast package)
arima_model <- auto.arima(sales_ts)

# Forecast sales for the next 4 months
forecast_result <- forecast(arima_model, h = 4)

# Display forecast results
print(forecast_result)
plot(forecast_result)
